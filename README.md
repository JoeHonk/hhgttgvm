Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Virtual Machine
 
I wanted to create a DOS VM to allow people to play Infocom's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Interactive Fiction Game as it was originally designed to be played. The not-so-recently rehashed web-based versions available online which include additional graphics and maps I find to be a little tacky and lend to removing the player from their own imagination. This may also be played using other DOS emulators and the original floppy images, but I think grabbing VirtualBox, and firing up a 3MB VM is a little easier for most people than setting up DOSBox and wrangling the files+configuration.
